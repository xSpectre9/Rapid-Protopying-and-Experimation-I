# Rapid-Protopying-and-Experimation-I

This is a code repository for the communication layer as part of the RPE-1 ISM.
There are 3 main folders in this repository:

1. Archive:
   
This contains files that showcase the process of building up to the final version of usable and integrable code.

2. Three Hexagons:
   
This folder contains the various files that are needed to get the communication layer running to link led-graph-mono and the  
 physical hardware build.
   
3. Touch Sensor Hexagon
   
This contains the files required to link led-graph-mono and the physical hardware build. It also contains a server file that  
 is required to detect touch sensor inputs.

The two text files contain the effects that are being generated by led-graph-mono and are being processed and sent to the physical hardware builds by the Three/Touch Sensor Hexagons.
