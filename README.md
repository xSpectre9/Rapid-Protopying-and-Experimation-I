# Rapid-Protopying-and-Experimation-I

This is a code repository worked on by me as part of the RPE-1 ISM.
There are 3 main folders in this repository:
1. Archive
   This contains files that showcase the process of building up to the final version of usable and integrable code.
2. Three Hexagons
   This folder contains the various files that are needed to get the communication layer running to link led-graph-mono and the     physical hardware build.
3. Touch Sensor Hexagon
   This contains the files required to link led-graph-mono and the physical hardware build. It also contains a server file that     required to detect touch sensor inputs.
